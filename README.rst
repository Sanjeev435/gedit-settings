===================
gEdit Configuration
===================

Configuration files for gEdit. The plugins are:

* ``trailsave``
* ``snapopen`` -- From https://github.com/rubencaro/gedit-snapopen-plugin, which
  was originally forked from Mads Buus Westmark's (MadsBuus) work.
  
Additional settings:

* Mimetype for reStructredText
* Syntax coloring borrowed from https://github.com/gmate/gmate to complement 
  gEdit's default selection of Classic, Cobalt, Kate, Oblivion, and Tango

The contents of the *related_settings* directory should be installed alongside
the *gedit* directory, probably in *~/.local/share/*.
